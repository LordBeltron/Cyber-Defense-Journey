# Day 2 – Log Fundamentals

## What I Did
- Practiced Git branching and merging.
- Opened Event Viewer → Security and System logs.
- Reviewed Event IDs 4624 (logon) and 4625 (failed logon).

## Key Learnings
- Logs are chronological records of system and network events.
- SIEMs collect and correlate logs from many sources.
- Each log entry includes time, source, ID, and description.

## Reflection
Seeing Windows logs helped me understand what SIEMs analyze and how alerts are generated.
